            <span>
                This project was an extension of another project I did in this class.
                The first project was a hardcoded set of levels that could be played through a 
                command line interface. This project was a continuation of that project by adding in a 
                syntax for a text file that can convert the text file into a level for the game. 
                The syntax is not the easiest but not too bad it uses nested characters to represent 
                sub areas in each level with you being able to add items and messages for the player to find.
            </span>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <span>
                I made this during my sophomore year and did not know how to use trees and other data 
                structures to help make the parsing easier.
            </span>
            <h3>Expansion</h3>
            <span>
                I would like to switch this project into python and then polish up the syntax 
                and add in some database functionality to store save data so that you can load a game.
