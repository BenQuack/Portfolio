            <span>
                I created a project similar to the Cereal app but not in a group setting
                and using a regular squlite3 database instead of the amazon firebase. I used
                ChatGPT to generate sample data and then created a command line query app
                that allowed users to see cross sections of libaries from different streaming services.
                each service was represented by their own table in the data base.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <span>
                The debugging for this project was tedious becuase to 
                run an SQL query from python you need to create the query string.
                This meant that you had to find what decsion tree caused the error,
                if that error could happen on multiple cases or just one, and then 
                restructure the code.
