            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <span>
                Created an amazon firebase to store a simple set of data.
                Then used python and the pyparsing package to create a command line
                interface. The parser could parse complex queries using 'and' as the keyword.
                I did design a query formatting function that was able to handle nested queries
                but that was out of the projects scope so it did not get fully implemented into the system
            </span>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <span>
                Some of the communication and issue tracking was lacking. That caused delays and I
                designed a function that was way overengineered for the project requirements. Some
                members of the group had simple formatting errors that were not noticed till the end.
