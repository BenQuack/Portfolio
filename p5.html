            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <span>
                I created a T-Shirt folding machine with some cardboard, a bread board,
                and a few servos. The servos were controlled by a python script ran on a Raspberry PI that would 
                just activate them in groups of two(two servos for each paddle).
            </span>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <span>
                I had never done any work with electronics before so I had to learn what
                parts I would need how they interface with the Raspberry PI and which python 
                libraries would work the best for the servos I bought. I also had to buy 
                a different set of servos becuase I did not understand power requirements and weight limits
                for servos.
            </span>
            <h3>Crashout?</h3>
            <span>
                Yes the first on was when trying to get the servos working. I tried multiple
                libraries to control them but there was alwasy something that was not quite right or even very 
                wrong. An example of that is the first generic library I found would create these ghost pulses
                that would make the servos twitch when the others ran. The second crashout was when right
                before I presented this project I managed to run a 9v battery right into the Raspberry PI this 
                suprising no one completely fried the board.
