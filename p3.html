            <span>
                For this project I created a simple video game using the SFML library. The gameplay
                was just moving around a square to doge enemies/obstacles. 
                The enemies were a circle that bounced around off the walls with a small amount 
                of randomization and player tracking added to the bouce calculations after a random
                amount of time the enemies would attack by staying still and 'impacting' the ground.
                you lost the game if you were hit by an enemy.

                This was my first time working with vectors to do player movemnet and at first 
                I wanted something more complex but doing player movemnet even now is difficult.
